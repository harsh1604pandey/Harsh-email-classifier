## 🚀 Project Overview



This is a production-ready **Email Classification System** for a support team.  

It automatically:



- Masks **PII** (email, phone, Aadhar, credit card, etc.)

- Classifies emails into support categories:

  - 📜 Billing Issues  

  - 🛠 Technical Support  

  - 👤 Account Management

- Exposes a **REST API** built using **FastAPI**

- Ready for **deployment on Hugging Face Spaces**



---



## 🧾 Features



- ✅ Regex-based PII Masking

- ✅ Traditional ML model (Naive Bayes)

- ✅ TF-IDF vectorization

- ✅ JSON API with strict format

- ✅ Hugging Face deployment ready
